- Learn to create and manage RESTful APIs and GraphQL endpoints.
- Explore the use of Docker for containerization and deployment.
- Understand the principles of microservices architecture and its application in real-world scenarios.

## Team Roles

The project is structured to simulate a real-world development environment, with team members assigned specific roles:

- **Backend Developers**: Focus on server-side logic, database interactions, and API development.
- **Database Administrators**: Design and manage the database schema, ensuring data integrity and performance.
- **QA Engineers**: Responsible for testing, bug tracking, and ensuring the quality of the application.
- **DevOps Engineers**: Manage deployment processes, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure.

## Technology Stack

The project utilizes a modern technology stack to ensure scalability, performance, and maintainability:

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- **Django REST Framework**: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database system known for its robustness and performance.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need.
- **Celery**: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments
- **Redis**: Used for caching and session management.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **Git and GitHub** For source code management and collaboration.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.
- **Testing**: PyTest, Postman - For unit testing and API testing.
- **Documentation**: Markdown, OpenAPI - For project documentation and API documentation.

## Database Design

The core entities for the Airbnb Clone Project are:

### Users

- **Fields**: id, name, email, password_hash, date_joined
- **Description**: Represents a person using the platform. A user can own multiple properties and make multiple bookings.

### Properties

- **Fields**: id, owner_id (User), title, description, location, price_per_night
- **Description**: Represents a property listed for rent. Each property is owned by a user.

### Bookings

- **Fields**: id, user_id, property_id, start_date, end_date, status
- **Description**: Represents a reservation made by a user for a property.

### Reviews

- **Fields**: id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment, created_at
- **Description**: Represents feedback left by a user for a property after a booking.

### Payments

- **Fields**: id, booking_id, amount, payment_date, status
- **Description**: Represents payment transactions for bookings.

#### Entity Relationships

- A **User** can own multiple **Properties**.
- A **User** can make multiple **Bookings**.
- A **Booking** is linked to one **Property** and one **User**.
- A **Property** can have multiple **Reviews**.
- A **Review** is written by a **User** for a **Property**.
- A **Booking** can have one **Payment**.

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management

Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management. This feature ensures secure access to the platform and allows users to manage their personal information and account settings.

### Property Management

Enables users to list, update, and remove properties for rent. Property owners can manage details such as descriptions, pricing, and availability, making it easy to showcase rental options to potential guests.

### Booking System

Allows users to search for available properties, make reservations, and manage their bookings. This feature coordinates property availability and ensures a smooth reservation process for both guests and hosts.

### Review System

Lets users leave feedback and ratings for properties they have stayed in. Reviews help maintain quality standards and provide valuable insights for future guests.

### Payment Processing

Manages secure payment transactions for bookings. This feature integrates with payment gateways to handle payments, refunds, and track transaction statuses, ensuring financial integrity.

### API & Security

Provides RESTful and GraphQL endpoints for frontend integration, with robust authentication and authorization mechanisms. This ensures data privacy and secure interactions between clients and the backend.

### Containerization & Deployment

Utilizes Docker and CI/CD pipelines for consistent deployment and scalability. This feature streamlines the development workflow and simplifies infrastructure management.

## API Security

Key security measures implemented in this project include:

- **Authentication**: Ensures only registered users can access protected resources by verifying user identities through secure methods such as JWT or OAuth.
- **Authorization**: Controls access to specific actions and data, ensuring users can only perform operations permitted by their roles (e.g., only property owners can modify their listings).
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and denial-of-service attacks by restricting the number of requests a user or client can make within a set timeframe.
- **Data Validation & Sanitization**: Protects against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting by validating and sanitizing all user inputs.
- **Secure Payment Processing**: Integrates with trusted payment gateways and encrypts sensitive transaction data to safeguard financial information.

Security is crucial for protecting user data, maintaining trust, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations. It also secures payment transactions, prevents unauthorized access, and helps maintain the integrity and availability of the platform.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes. They help ensure that new features and fixes are reliably integrated into the project, reducing manual errors and speeding up development cycles.

For this project, tools such as **GitHub Actions** are used to automate testing and deployment workflows, while **Docker** ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production. These tools together enable rapid, reliable, and scalable delivery of application updates.
